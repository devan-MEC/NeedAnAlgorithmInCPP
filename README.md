# NeedAnAlgorithmInCPP
I need a viable algorithm. More details inside README

The alogirthm which I require in basic Cpp is one which can assign random values to a 2 dimensional integer matrix such that, 
all the adjoining elements to an element differs from the element in a random manner but doesn't differ from it more than a value of 5.
